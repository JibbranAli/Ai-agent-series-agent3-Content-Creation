# Content Creation Agent Requirements
# No external dependencies required - uses only standard Python libraries

# Standard library modules used:
# - json: For data serialization
# - re: For text processing and pattern matching
# - os: For file system operations
# - sys: For system-specific parameters and functions
# - typing: For type hints
# - dataclasses: For data class definitions
# - datetime: For timestamp generation

# All functionality is built using Python standard library,
# making the agent portable and dependency-free.

# Optional: If you want to enhance the agent with external libraries, 
# here are some recommended additions:

# textstat>=0.7.3  # For readability analysis
# wordcloud>=1.9.2  # For keyword visualization
# requests>=2.31.0  # For web scraping capabilities
# beautifulsoup4>=4.12.2  # For HTML parsing
# nltk>=3.9999  # For advanced text processing
